# Andrew R. Gray's Personal Site

Thank you for taking the time to view this repository!

This is the source code repository for me, Andrew R. Gray, a veteran software developer of 10 years.  This is an Angular site that demonstrates some of my coding capabilities.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.2, but has since been upgraded to Angular 13.

Due to the limited nature of this site, this code runs fully front-end; there's simply no need for backend API dependencies...yet.

If you have questions or ideas, or are interested in hiring me, please contact me at andrew.russel.gray -at- gmail -dot- com.  My inbox is a busy place, though, and I'm a busy man, so it may take me some time to see your message.
